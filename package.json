  "description": "* This site is an online loan and mortgage calculator, \r the template and appearance are \r made according to the real mortgage calculator, \r which I took as an example from the Sberbank website. This is my \r version of the calculator.\r * [Sbarbank site](https://www.sberbank.ru/ru/person/credits/home/buying_complete_house) is here.\r There you can see original online sber-calc.\r * ## My project is logically built according to the mvc pattern. \r However, I want to mention some features, that distinguish my logic from the most familiar MVC behavior. In my case there are:\r * Model -- Which is responsible only for the data.\r * View -- This is not only the appearance or the presentation, I also implemented listening to various events, input, initialization here. So VIEW is not responsible ONLY for displaying the UI on the screen.\r * Controller -- Which responsible for linking data to the display and is responsible for synchronizing the model and view.",
